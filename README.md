### 🏎️ - Context

[Pierre Sancinena](https://www.google.com/search?q=pierre+sancinena&oq=pierre+sancinena&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59j69i65j69i61j69i60l2j69i61l2.2747j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#cobssid=s) is an aerodynamic engineer for Alpine, a racing driver, a world champion in GT4 on Alpine, a coach for the young pilots of the brand, and incidentally co-founder of a driving school on historic formula ford. He wants to set up a company aimed at a market that is not yet addressed, that of automobile coaching in competition.

The idea is simple: Make an app that connects drivers with coaches.
  - The coaches sell their time slots.
  - The pilots buy these slots and provide a link to their videos.

### ✅ - Features

- A visitor can browse the site and he has access to several information:
  - The profile of the different coaches and their availability
  - The list of available cars
  - The list of available tracks

- When he registers he can:
  - Propose availabilities as a coach (with a price)
  - Sign up for coaching slots as a driver (specifying the car, the circuit, the means of communication, and if necessary the URL of the video)
  - The payment of the session is done on Stripe
